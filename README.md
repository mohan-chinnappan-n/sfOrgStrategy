### Salesforce org strategy
#### Operating model
Companies with the high **unification** should have fewer orgs 

Companies with unique business units with the **need to know each other transactions** should have single org.
 example: Merrill Lynch, MetLife 
 
Companies with Independent businesses **but similar businesses** can consider using multiple organizations
 example: Marriott
 
 Companies with independent businesses and different customers and expertise can have  multiple orgs.
  example: Johnson Johnson, GE
